# Supervised-Learning-by-Gradient-Descent-Tile-Coding
Learning algorithm we use is stochastic gradient descent in the weights of a linear function approximator; it is known as the Least-Mean-Square (LMS) algorithm in the literature. 

Language: Python 2.7
IDE: Visual Studio 2015

###Description:
The sentence above literally describes what is going on. We have three python files here, each with it's own particular purpose.


##Additional files:
We provided two graphs of the results of the data, which allows a visual representation for anyone interested! :)
They are the following:
